                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>I have always enjoyed being creative and found exploring new areas and designing to be a lot of fun. Whether this was designing a text-based browser RPG or creating my first website with my sister at about 10 years old or spending my teenage years graphic designing on Tumblr, designing has always been a passion of mine. The only difference is that now I consider more factors when designing because I have learned new skills and techniques (and am continuing to do so). Besides designing, I enjoy reading, blogging, writing, gaming, baking desserts, trying new food places, watching shows and traveling to new places.<br></br>

                        <p>
                            At BookingPal, I am currently working on the UI and UX design for the company's new product that will be both a web app for both desktop and mobile. In the past, I worked on completely redesigning the UI and improving the UX for the company's customer portal. I also contributed to other parts of UI design work such as designing the reservation flows and payment pages in different templates for BookingPal's partnerning platforms (including collaboration with Marriott). I collaborate with product managers and the engineering team to ensure delivery of the best UI/UX across BookingPal products.

                        <p>

                            At SHARP, I provided a UX perspective and direction to the developer team I worked with through my work consisting of competitor analysis, user journeys, wireframes, rapid prototyping and conducting usability testing of project concepts and testing demo prototypes created by the team at the end of each quarter.
                            <br></br>
                            I researched and followed design trends and industry standards to create UI & UX designs for mobile and web applications (depending what project the team was working on). One of my major deliverables for a 10 month project was a design for a beta level mobile application, conclusions & findings from user research on our target customers, and design ideas and recommendations for the mobile app moving forward.

                            <br></br>
                            I worked in an Agile process with 1-2 week sprints where I would present research findings, design concepts and UX recommendations to the product owner, managers, development team at the end of each sprint.

                            At HireRight, I conducted user acceptance testing on their new software product across both web and mobile platforms using both real devices and cross browser testing. I ran test cases and identified, logged and reported any defects that were found. My job also included writing new test cases and identifying and suggesting new ways to improve the product. <br></br>I attended weekly meetings to discuss our product, deadlines and changes within the company or product. Working with business analysts, product managers and developers, I helped ensure that HireRight's new software product had the best possible user interface and experience before being released to customers.

                            For fun, I wrote, edited and managed content for an online published fashion blog called "The Haberdash". I wrote numerous articles about topics including lifestyle, pop culture and the latest trends in fashion, beauty and technology.<br><br />

                            I worked with the Editor-in-chief and Founder/CEO of the company. As Editor, I was also responsible for managing a team of writers in the Orange County Area and editing articles that were ready to be scheduled for publish. Working with the team and CEO, I attended meetings, worked with social media, and discussed strategizes about marketing, recuritment, brand promoting and SEO optimization for the blog and ultimately, the fashion-tech app Haberdashion.

                    <h4>Jan 2018 - Oct 2018</h4>
                    <p><i>Instawork</i> is a design concept for an Android app created for a work related project that spanned over 9 months. </p>

                    <p><b>See demo video under "View Demo" at the bottom.</b></p>

                    <p><b>Role:</b> Lead UI/UX designer, UX Researcher</p>

                    <p><b>Tools:</b> Adobe XD, Adobe Photoshop CC, Lucidchart</p>
                    <p><b>Background: </b> This project consisted of trying to understand different workplace enviornments and how to improve workflow and collaboration throughout offices.</p>

                    <p><b>Research: </b>To identify the problem, validate our solution and understand our users, a number of research methods were utilized. This included reading papers and articles to cover preliminary research of problems, enviornments, and potential users.
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="bullets"><b class="bold-other">Field Studies:</b> This was conducted to gauge open and closed workspace floorplans and how work enviornment may affect work habits. This involved visiting shared workspace environments (e.g. companies and coworking spaces) to observe workers in their natural environment and gain insight into user’s behavioral patterns. </li>
                            <li class="bullets"><b class="bold-other">Phone Surveys: </b>I formulated survey questions, analyzed and drew conclusions from target customers. This method was used to validate whether our product was going in the right direction and understand customer's backgrounds and frustrations.</li>
                            <li class="bullets"><b class="bold-other">Roleplay:</b> Roleplaying was used as an initial method to test out the project’s design concept on potential users and verify how the scenarios worked. Mockups were created for screens and phones, I acted as the system and a user depending on the scenario and user testers were given a role to act out. Interviews were conducted at the end and findings were pieced together using design thinking methodlogies. </li>

                    <img class="" src="images/instawork/UserJourney.PNG" alt="" /><br>

                    <b>Ideation</b>
                    <li class="bullets">Started with sketching out basic design layouts for both the mobile and web app, which gave me an idea of what features we needed to include and how each element related to the concept. </li>
                    <b>Wireframes</b>
                    <li class="bullets">After going through many iterations of paper sketches I began creating wireframes with Adobe XD. Many different ideas were explored and created conceptually, before I put together 3 different interactive mobile prototypes.</li>
                    <li class="bullets">2 different interactive versions of a web app for this project was also created. <b class="bold-other">See "Admin Dashboard" project.</b></li>
                    <b>User Testing</b>
                    <li class="bullets">With the 3 different interactive prototypes, they were downloaded onto an Android phone and presented to potential users to begin testing the concept. My coworker and I conducted moderated usability testing by giving each user a set of tasks and asking them to complete these tasks with each of the separate prototypes. </li>

                                <p><b>Reflection:</b> For this project, I learned more on how to build in native Android, making API calls, working with a real client, and putting my design skills to use. Because this was a PoC, there were many changes both in UI design and with features that we would have liked to have changed or included, but given the time frame, was not possible. For the design, I chose different shades of red because that went along with Sharp's company colors. I maintained a consistent use of dark reds for text fields, a brighter red for buttons with white text for contrast, and gray for headings and informative text. If time permitted, I would have liked to have cleaned up the UI design and overall UX because some designs on the Smart Office Assitant app were implemented simply for it to be functional instead of to provide a good UX. For example, the display of meetings on the Home screen is not very asesthetically pleasing and could be displayed in a much less cluttered format. </p>

                                <p><b>Problem: </b>Pet shelters are often overburdened with the amount of pets they take in and when pets are not adopted within a certain time frame, pets are often put down. Owners looking for new pets often resort to buying pets as opposed to adopting those that need a home.</p>

                                <p><b>Solution:</b> In an effort to save more pets, we created Pettr to give a platform for pet owners, potential pet owners and pet shelters to connect. This gives those looking to adopt pets an option to find their dream pet on our platform. Future ideas for expansion and improvements includ allowing pet play dates or temporary pet sitting to be set up. </p>

                                    <li class="bullets"><b class="bold-other">Competitive Analysis:</b> We did research on competitor products to see which kind of pet adoption apps (mobile or web) already existed and how we would differentiate from them. </li>
